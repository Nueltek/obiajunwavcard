A Simple QR Code Project: I have developed a straightforward QR code project. Using HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, I crafted a basic page showcasing the client's profile. The concept behind it is to build a uncomplicated website, host it on GitHub, and then connect it to a QR code generator I learned to create from Angela Yu's Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy.
